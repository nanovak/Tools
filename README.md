# Tools

Parking lot for scripts and things

## IPAddressMailer

This is a customized version of Robert Cain's tool that checks regularly to see if you public IP has changed and sends an email if it has.
I've added support for IPv6 and changed the service used to check your machine's public IP.

## RepoSyncJob

This is a Windows batch file method to regularly update GIT repos on your local machine. The intent is to set this up as a recurring scheduled task.

  UnscheduleIPAddressMailer.ps1

  This script is a companion to the ScheduleIPAddressMailer.ps1 script.
  It will remove (delete) all scheduled tasks it creates. 

  Note it assumes that any task beginning with "SendExternalIP_at"
  were created by the ScheduleIPAddressMailer.ps1, so if you create one
  manually with the same prefix it too will be deleted.

  While this script is designed to work with the IPAddressMailer system,
  it could easily be adapted to remove any set of scheduled tasks. 
   
  This script was designed to be run by the average person who may not be
  a PowerShell expert. As such I included many Write-Host statements, 
  to give the user feedback that things were working. 

  If you are a system admin who will regularly run this in unattended mode,
  just remove the Write-Host cmdlet calls.

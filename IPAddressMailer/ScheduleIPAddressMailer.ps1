  ScheduleIPAddressMailer.ps1

  Author: Robert C. Cain | @ArcaneCode | info@arcanetc.com
          http://arcanecode.me

  This script will create Windows Scheduled Tasks to execute the PowerShell
  script IPAddressMailer.ps1. 
  
  Note that the IPAddressMailer.ps1 script must reside in a folder outside 
  the standard user folders such as Documents or their OneDrive folder. 
  We suggest you create a folder named C:\IPAddressMailer to hold all 
  scripts for IPAddressMailer.
  
  See the notes within this script for items you as a user of this script
  will want to update. 

  If you want to remove all tasks created with this script, a companion
  script UnscheduleIPAddressMailer.ps1 is provided. 

  While designed to schedule the IPAddressMailer.ps1 script, this script
  could be easily adapted to setup scheduled tasks to run any PowerShell 
  script. 

  This script was designed to be run by the average person who may not be
  a PowerShell expert. As such I included many Write-Host statements, 
  to give the user feedback that things were working. 

  If you are a system admin who will regularly run this in unattended mode,
  just remove the Write-Host cmdlet calls.

# To add more times, just put a comma after the last time, hit enter, then

# By default the script assumes you are putting the IPAddressMailer.ps1 file
# in it's own folder. If you change it, be sure to update the path below.

# Note you need to put it in a folder outside a user area. In other words don't
# use the documents folder, or OneDrive, use something on the C drive.
